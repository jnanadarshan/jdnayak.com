Hi, my name is Jnanadarshan Nayak. I like to live every moment, learn something new every day and participate in initiatives for the betterment of all of us. Currently, as of April 05, 2020, I work as a Strategy Consultant at TATA Consultancy Services which is Asia's largest IT Services provider.


I have completed my MBA in Business Management from Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB) in the year 2017. Prior to that, I have worked as a Business Intelligence Developer at Syntel Limited (Now Atos Syntel) from 2015 to 2017. I joined Syntel post completion of B-Tech in Electronics and Instrumentation in 2012.

***

I strongly believe that:

> The primary aim of businesses should be to work for society, employees and then shareholders. Any business that exists should work towards solving challenges faced by us either directly or indirectly.

***

I love technology and believe it can solve the greatest challenges faced by humanity with maximum efficiency and side effects and aim to work towards that. I have an interest in Semiconductors, Networks, Public Sector and Sustainability.
